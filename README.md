# Instructions:
Here are the tasks performed in the provided code along with their descriptions, with the headings in bold:

**1. Package Installation:**
   - Installation of necessary packages (`tensorflow` and `transformers`) using pip.

**2. Library and Module Import:**
   - Importing required libraries and modules for data processing, modeling, and evaluation.

**3. NLTK Resource Download:**
   - Downloading NLTK resources including tokenizers, corpora, and models necessary for text processing tasks.

**4. Dataset Loading:**
   - Loading a dataset from an Excel file containing text data and corresponding labels.

**5. Text Preprocessing:**
   - Preprocessing the text data including tokenization, stopword removal, POS tagging, lemmatization, and sentiment analysis.

**6. Preprocessed Data Storage:**
   - Creation of a DataFrame to store the preprocessed text data along with relevant information.

**7. Preprocessed Data Saving:**
   - Saving the preprocessed DataFrame to an Excel file for further analysis or usage.

**8. Preprocessed Dataset Loading:**
   - Loading the preprocessed dataset from the previously saved Excel file.

**9. Text Tokenization:**
   - Tokenization of text data using BERT tokenizer from Hugging Face's Transformers library.

**10. Label Encoding:**
    - Encoding the categorical labels into numerical format using `LabelEncoder`.

**11. Label Categorical Conversion:**
    - Converting the encoded labels into categorical format using `to_categorical` from TensorFlow.

**12. Dataset Splitting:**
    - Splitting the dataset into training and testing sets for model training and evaluation.

**13. Model Construction:**
    - Building a neural network model using TensorFlow's Keras API, including layers and configuration.

**14. Model Compilation:**
    - Compiling the neural network model with specified optimizer, loss function, and evaluation metrics.

**15. Model Training:**
    - Training the compiled model on the training dataset.

**16. Training Visualization:**
    - Visualizing training and validation accuracy using Matplotlib.

**17. Loss Visualization:**
    - Visualizing training and validation loss using Matplotlib.

**18. Model Evaluation:**
    - Evaluating the trained model performance on the testing dataset, including accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score, and support.

**19. Confusion Matrix Calculation:**
    - Calculating the confusion matrix to evaluate the model's classification performance.

**20. Confusion Matrix Visualization:**
    - Displaying the confusion matrix using Seaborn's heatmap for better visualization.

**21. Sentiment Label Distribution Visualization:**
    - Creating a pie chart to visualize the distribution of sentiment labels in the dataset.
